Aim: Less dependent on exact execution period
     - use measured timestep to predict pose in DWA
     - enable non-lookup mode that takes into account
       the actual time since last call (see also below)

Aim: Cleanup for external use
     - Some many \todo comments should be \note
     - Remove api/types.hpp, use std::size_t instead of sfl::index_t
     - Make use of BubbleFactory optional (but KEEP it, make it a
       configurable behavior)
     - Make use of (compressed) lookup optional in DWA (but KEEP it,
       make it configurable behavior)

Aim: Port to OpenRobots
     DONE - Replace HALProxy class by C struct with function pointers
     DONE - Invent eg handle-based opaque access to objects in C wrappers
            that provide an API eg on a per-directory basis.
     - Extract multi-tasking stuff from XOberon code (ie mutexes and
       initialization of threads)

Aim: Promote use by Cogniron partners
     - Write XCF wrapper
     - Write PlayerStage wrapper
     DONE - Create autotools scripts for those who don't have SCons
     - Include boost::smart_ptr library in package (check licence first!)

Aim: Make self-testing
     - Resurrect cppunit code in api/test

Aim: Less dependent on exact execution period
     - use measured timestep to predict pose in DWA
     - enable non-lookup mode that takes into account
       the actual time since last call
       ==> actually trivial with recent refactorings, mod -1 urgency

Aim: Cleanup for external use
     - Some (many) \todo comments should be \note
     DONE - Remove api/types.hpp, use std::size_t instead of sfl::index_t,
            unsigned int, or (gasp!) int
     - Make use of BubbleFactory optional (but KEEP it, make it a
       configurable behavior)
     - Make use of (compressed) lookup optional in DWA (but KEEP it,
       make it configurable behavior)
       ==> actually trivial with recent refactorings, mod -1 urgency

Aim: Port to OpenRobots
     DONE - Replace HALProxy class by C struct with function pointers
     DONE - Invent eg handle-based opaque access to objects in C wrappers
            that provide an API eg on a per-directory basis.
     - Extract multi-tasking stuff from XOberon code (ie mutexes and
       initialization of threads), priorities:
         - make use of mutexes configurable
         - round-robin mutexed laser scans
         - mutexed odometry
         - mutexed motion controller
         - multi-threaded mutexed nf1/bband/dwa

Aim: Promote use by Cogniron partners
     DONE - Write XCF wrapper
     - Write PlayerStage wrapper
     DONE - Create autotools scripts for those who don't have SCons
     - Include boost::smart_ptr library in package (check licence first!)

Aim: Make self-testing
     - Resurrect cppunit code in api/test

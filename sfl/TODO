Aim: Less dependent on exact execution period
     - use measured timestep to predict pose in DWA
     - enable non-lookup mode that takes into account
       the actual time since last call
       ==> actually trivial with recent refactorings, mod -1 urgency

Aim: Cleanup for external use
     - Make use of BubbleFactory optional (but KEEP it, make it a
       configurable behavior)
     - Make use of (compressed) lookup optional in DWA (but KEEP it,
       make it configurable behavior)
       ==> actually trivial with recent refactorings, mod -1 urgency

Aim: Port to OpenRobots
     - Extract multi-tasking stuff from XOberon code (ie mutexes and
       initialization of threads), priorities:
         - make use of mutexes configurable
         DONE - round-robin mutexed laser scans
         DONE - mutexed odometry
         DONE - mutexed motion controller
         - multi-threaded mutexed nf1/bband/dwa
     - Test multithreading: add update threads to
       DONE - Scanner
       DONE - Odometry
       DONE - MotionController
       DONE - BubbleBand (maybe later separate ReplanHandler and
              BubbleFactory)
URGENT: ugly bband/bfactory, need to liberate more ticks for readers!!!
       - DynamicWindow and/or expo::MotionPlanner
         ==> will stay "main push" thread for the moment...

Aim: Make self-testing
     - Resurrect cppunit code in api/test

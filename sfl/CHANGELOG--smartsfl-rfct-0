TraversabilityMap can now (optionally) be accessed via POSIX rwlocks,
useful in cases (like smartflower) where the traversability data is
shared between several threads. The RWTravmap header defines two
proxies: RDTravmap for read-only, and WRTravmap for read-write, access
of TraversabilityMap instances. The relevant API of TraversabilityMap
is forwarded.
Mapper2d still uses the legacy TraversabilityMap internally, but adds
a RWlock to protect access to it blockwise. However, clients are now
constrained to using either Mapper2d::CreateRDTravmap() or
Mapper2d::CreateWRTravmap() to access the data, which ensures that it
does not get inconsistent.

1. INTRODUCTION

Sunflower is a project that contains mobile robotic programming
abstractions developed at the Autonomous Systems Lab. It is written in
C++ and provides a framework of classes and utilities for common tasks
and patterns in mobile robotics. As a concrete application of those
abstractions, sunflower contains obstacle avoidance code developed
during a PhD thesis at the Autonomous Systems Lab. It is described in
chapter 3 of [1].


2. COMPILING

There are two ways of building sunflower: With SCons [2] or the
classical autotools approach using "configure && make && make
install". This software has been compiled under Linux and Mac OS X,
but as it is relatively pure C++ it should not be hard to port to
other POSIX platforms. Sunflower requires C and C++ compilers (tested
with GCC-3), the Boost smart_ptr library [3], and some additional
components that depend on how you want to build it.

2.1 Build with SCons

You will need the the Scons build system [2] (which in turn requires
Python). Then, compiling should be as simple as typing "scons" in the
top-level directory.

Installing with SCons is a bit cumbersome at the moment.  This release
uses a staged build, after compilation there will be two new
subdirectories called "inc" and "lib", which contain the sunflower
headers and the compiled libraries. Copy those files to the
appropriate location on your system if you want to install sunflower.

2.2 Build with autotools

The sunflower library comes with a configure script that will do it's
best to detect how the build will work on your system. The recommended
way of building is in a separate directory:

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ ../configure --prefix=YOUR_PREFERRED_INSTALLATION_PATH
 $ make
 $ make install

Note that the last command might require root privileges depending on
the permissions of YOUR_PREFERRED_INSTALLATION_PATH.


DOCUMENTATION

Sunflower uses Doxygen [4] to provide documentation through comments
inside the sourcecode. You can either rely on the fact that the vast
majority of these comments is in the class declarations (ie header
files), or use the provided Doxyfile to create the HTML version under
doc/html (Doxygen also supports other formats, just modify the
Doxyfile accordingly).


PROJECT LAYOUT

util/
 Basic classes and other utilities.

api/
 Mobile robotic abstractions, some with default implementations,
 others in form of interfaces.

dwa/
 An implementation of the Dynamic Window Approach to obstacle
 avoidance, modified for differential drive robots and with
 pre-calculated lookup-tables for very fast execution.

bband/
 An implementation of a radically simplified Elastic Band approach to
 on-line path modification, aimed at keeping computations very
 lightweight but sacrifycing accuracy.

gplan/
 An early attempt at generalized grid-based path planners, only useful
 for it's implementation of the NF1 planner. (The E-Star project
 provides a more powerful approach but has not been released yet.)

expo/
 The integrated path planning and obstacle avoidance system used
 during the Swiss National Exhibition expo.02. For 6 months it
 controlled 10 Robox tour guide robots at the Robotics pavillion.

cwrap/
 A C-wrapper for the sunflower library that allows to integrate it's
 obstacle avoidance capavilities in non-C++ code.
 THIS PART OF THE PROJECT IS EXPERIMENTAL!

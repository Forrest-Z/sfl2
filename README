Nepumuk is a simple two-dimensional mobile robot simulator. At the
time of writing, it compiles under Linux and Mac OS X, provided you
have the following things installed on your computer:

* The scons build system <http://www.scons.org>, a powerful
  source configuration and build tool.
* The development packages for OpenGL / Mesa3D and GLUT (the OpenGL
  Utility Toolkit). Check your OS documentation to find out how to
  install these.
* The API and utilities of ASL's mobile robot software architecture
  project: sunflower-light-0.1
  <http://asl.epfl.ch/~rolo/sunflower-light.html>
* The ASL's path planning and obstacle avoidance components for
  sunflower: sunflower-oa-1.0
  <http://asl.epfl.ch/~rolo/sunflower-oa.html>

If all these things are installed, compiling nepumuk should be
straightforward: Just type "scons" from the project root on the
command line. The executable called 'nepumuk' will then be in the
simul/ and bin/ subdirectories. Documentation can be found in the doc/
subdirectory. It is far from complete, don't hesitate to contact the
author if you have questions.
